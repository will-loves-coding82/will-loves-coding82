- 👋 Hi, I’m @will-loves-coding82.. 
- 🌱 I'm a fourth year student at UCSD. I love making frontend-focused applications. I'm committed to organizations like ACM AI at UCSD where I currently work as a frontend developer to make beautiful frontend designs (https://ai.acmucsd.com/) and the San Diego Supercomputer Center where I work as a backend dev to assist in software solutions for clients.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any small projects to get my hands dirty.
